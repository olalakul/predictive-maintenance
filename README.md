# Predictive Maintenace on the example of Turbofan dataset

In this project I analyse the turbofan dataset and build models to predict the failure of technical units based on sensor data

##### I discuss the  following topics:

1. Identify useful and useless sensors by quick visual inspection of time series
1. Define RUL = Remaining Useful Lifetime for each unit
1. How to scale/normalize measurements of each sensor
1. Train/Validation/Test data splitting
1. Reformuate the prediction problem mathematically - define the value that we want to predict
1. Build and train the simplest LSTM model and analyse the results
1. Refomulate the mathematical details (namely loss function) according to business value
1. Retrain the model with asymmetric loss
